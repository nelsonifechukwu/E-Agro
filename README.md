# IoT miniGreenhouse

The aim of this project is to design an IoT system to improve crop production by monitoring and controlling factors (light, air, and temperature and soil moisture) that affect the production using **Blynk**. The objectives of this project are:

+ To identify the different environmental factors that enhance optimal crop growth.
+ To design a Smart greenhouse monitoring and control system
+ To implement and deploy a Smart greenhouse monitoring and control system
